Project Name: PH Tour Management System Backend
Version: 1.0
Prepared By: Next Level Team
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
To develop a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web application that allows users to book tours across Bangladesh, while providing admin and management capabilities for tour operators.
1.2 Scope
The system will include modules for:
- User registration and authentication
- Tour listing and filtering
- Booking and payment processing
- Admin panel for managing users, tours, guides, and transactions
- Integration with SSLCommerz for online payments
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
JWT - JSON Web Token for authentication
RBAC - Role-Based Access Control
CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
SPA - Single Page Application
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

    • NFR3: Backend should be horizontally scalable.
    • NFR4: Passwords must be hashed (e.g., bcrypt).
    • NFR5: JWT tokens must be securely stored and validated.
    • NFR6: Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced.
    • NFR7: Payment data must be securely transmitted using HTTPS.
    • NFR8: System must ensure 99.5% uptime.
    • NFR9: Redis used for transient data like OTPs must be fault-tolerant.
    • NFR10: Code should be modular and follow MVC architecture.
5. System Architecture Overview
Backend: Node.js (Express), MongoDB, Redis
Frontend: React/Next.js (separate)
Auth: JWT, OTP via SMS/Email
Payment: SSLCommerz
Deployment: Vercel
6. External Interface Requirements
User Interface: Separate SPA frontend that consumes JSON APIs.
API Interface: RESTful APIs structured under `/api/v1`
Hardware Interface: Hosted on cloud or VPS (e.g., Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean)
Software Interface: Compatible with MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud, or local deployments
7. Data Requirements
Key Entities:
- User: name, phone, email, password, role, verified
- Tour: title, description, price, images, division, slug
- Booking: userId, tourId, date, status, paymentStatus
- Payment: bookingId, transactionId, status, amount
8. Use Case Scenarios
Use Case: Booking a Tour
1. User registers and verifies via OTP.
2. User logs in and browses tours.
3. User selects a tour and submits booking.
4. System creates booking (status: pending).
5. User is redirected to SSLCommerz.
6. On payment success, booking is confirmed.
9. Acceptance Criteria
Users can register, log in, and book tours
Admin can manage tours, users, bookings
Payments update booking statuses correctly
All APIs are secured and role-protected
System meets NFRs for performance and security
